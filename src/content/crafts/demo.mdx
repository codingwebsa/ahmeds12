Another thing *that* we **enjoyed** as a ~team~ was ~~breaking~~ the design up __into__ chunks. Not very systematically from the get-go, but mostly intuitively as we went along. We had big ambitions for the page, but instead of dragging an already massive pull request out, we shipped the static version as soon as it was an improvement over what was already in production. Animations and adjustments to other surfaces could follow up later.

In no particular order, we'll break down a couple of implementation details, some of which may be less trivial than others, but all of them were stimulating to build.

```js {2} showLineNumbers
async function test() {
  console.log("Testing")
}
```

One of the first details you'll notice on the hero are container grid lines. They are absolutely positioned pseudo elements and are flexible based on the inner content and different screen sizes.

```python title="main.py"
def test:
    pass
```

```ts title="main.ts" /console/
async function test(): string {
  // Hello there from demo craft
  console.log("Testing")
  return "test"
}
```

# Hello h1

## What to expect from here on out

### Hello h3

#### Hello h4

##### Hello h5

###### Hello h6

I borrowed a technique from [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for these. By using a repeating linear gradient to create a dotted line we can control the dots more precisely compared to a dotted `border` property. We can also fade out the edges on the same element with a mask.

> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?

The light glow is a CSS shadow. However, the only properties being animated are opacity and transform. Animating box-shadow would not be ideal since it would trigger a browser re-paint on every frame of the animation. Likely not to be a problem on modern computers, but older, less powerful devices, like smartphones, may drop frames and make the motion look sluggish.

Instead, we toggle the opacity of pseudo elements with a shadow:
    <Image
          src="/images/crafts/demo/demo.jpg"
          width="718"
          height="404"
          alt="Image"
        />

## Using vodeo with nextjs to modify the default behavior & optimization

              width="718"
              height="404"
              alt="Image"
            />
